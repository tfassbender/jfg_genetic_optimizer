# jfg_genetic_optimizer

This project includes an implementation of a genetic optimization algorithm.

The algorithm uses heredity and mutation to optimize a solution to a given problem.
(Like random testing all permutations but much faster)

The libary can be used to modell a problem and let the algorithm solve it.
